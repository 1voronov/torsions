# Supplementary Code for the Analysis of Limit Cycle in a Dusty Plasma Torsion

This repository provides supplementary code for analyzing limit cycles in a dusty plasma torsion system. The implementation consists of two main procedures:

## 1. Running an Ensemble of Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations
Execute the ensemble simulations using the following script:
```bash
bash run_ensemble.sh
```

## 2. Analyzing the Trajectories
Analyze the simulation data with the analysis script:
```bash
python analyse_data.py
```
